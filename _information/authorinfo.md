## Instructions for Camera-ready Submissions
The conference proceedings for Robotics: Science and Systems 2021 will be
published online with open access, and in a book.  A revised version of your
paper is due to be uploaded to CMT by AOE ~~June 10, 2021~~ <span style="color:red;">June 25,</span> 2021.
Please be aware that
there will be no additional opportunity to revise your paper. 

In preparing for the proceedings, please follow the author guidelines posted
below under “Paper Format” and these [requirements and
recommendations]({{site.baseurl}}/information/paperformatting).  Your
proceedings submission should, of course, include your names, affiliations, and
acknowledgements as we are past the double-blind review phase. 
There is no provision for supplementary materials in the proceedings, so please
embed links in your pdf to stable URLs for any additional content.  


<u>Note</u>: Like the original submission, no arbitrary page limits are placed on your camera ready paper.  As a rule: *it should contain material that has undergone peer review, or be in response to the requests that arose during the review process.*  This may mean your paper may be a bit longer than your submitted manuscript in most cases, this to be an additional page or so. Use this additional freedom responsibly.

## Supplementary Materials
Authors may submit supplementary material such as a video or an expanded version of a proof. The deadline for supplementary material is the same as for paper submission. Note that reviewers are not required to view this material and include it in their assessment of the paper. Lastly, if authors feel they must link to additional supplementary material, they are cautioned to ensure that their identities are not revealed. Please note that the link to upload supplementary material becomes active only after the paper submission is complete.

## Double Blind Submission

Reviewing for RSS 2021 will be double blind, so authors should not be listed on
the title page and reasonable anonymity should be maintained in the paper.
Authors are asked to take particular care when referencing their own work &mdash; 
careless use of self citations can easily violate the requirements for double
blind reviewing and this will result in papers being rejected. 

Double Blind reviewing requires that the paper reviewers should not know the names or affiliation of the paper authors. This is desirable to remove any possible or perceived bias toward a paper on non technical grounds. However, in practice this is difficult to achieve in full as descriptions of background material or experiments, which are essential to the technical content of the paper, often give a clear indication to knowledgeable reviewers of the likely source of the paper. RSS 2021 will try to adopt a pragmatic approach to double blind reviewing in which authors are encouraged to hide identity without unduly affecting the quality or import of their submission.

The following general principles should be applied in submissions:

* Authors names and affiliations should not be cited in the title or text of the submission.
* Acknowledgments to people or funding agencies should not appear in the submission.
* Citing of web links to the authors or author's institute should be avoided.

In self citing authors previous work, avoid expressions such as "In the authors earlier work...", rather use alternative expressions such as "In previous work..." or "In related work...", in a manner that does not distinguish their own work from the work of others. Authors should otherwise cite work, including their own, as required for the completeness of the submission.

In presentation of experimental work, avoid logos in pictures, or overt references to an individual laboratory. Use expressions such as "The experimental equipment..." rather than "The University of XYZ's Robby the Robot...". Otherwise authors should include photographs, graphics and other presentation material as in the normal manner for a paper submission.

In general authors should avoid obviously attributable self-references while ensuring that the paper is complete, makes appropriate citations of related work and fully describes the contributions made.


## Multiple Submissions
Submissions that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have
been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been
submitted in parallel to other conferences are not appropriate for RSS and
violate our dual submission policy. 
Exceptions to this rule are the following:

1. Submission is permitted of a short version of a paper that has been submitted to a journal, but has not yet been published in that journal. Authors must declare such dual-submissions either through the paper upload submission form, or via email to the program chair. It is the authors' responsibility to make sure that the journal in question allows dual concurrent submissions to conferences.
2. Submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published.
3. It is acceptable to submit to RSS work that has been made available as a technical report (or similar, e.g. in arXiv) without citing it.

None of the above override the requirements of other publishing venues. In addition, keep in mind that author anonymity to RSS reviewers might be compromised for authors availing themselves of exceptions 2 and 3.


## Plagiarism
RSS is utterly intolerant of plagiarism. Submitted papers are expected to contain original work executed by the authors with adequate, proper and scholarly citations to the work of others. It is the job of the authors to clearly identify both their own contribution(s) and also published results / techniques on which they depend or build. RSS reviewers are charged to ensure these standards are met. In cases of alleged plagiarism, the program chair will be guided by Section 8.2.4 Allegations of Misconduct as laid out by the IEEE in this <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/opsmanual.pdf">document</a>.

## Review Process
Authors, Program Committee members, and Area Chairs will all be anonymous. Each paper will receive 3 reviews.
Consistent with last year, we will not have conditional acceptances, nor will we have a full author-to-reviewer rebuttal process,
instead we will keep the opportunity to write a post-review response to the Area Chairs.

## Instructions for uploading the pre-recorded paper spotlight presentations {#videos}
{: .text-left}

At RSS 2021 all paper presentations will be pre-recorded. They will be
hosted on YouTube and will be made available before the conference and
stay accessible indefinitely (similar to the recordings of the talks
from years 2020 and 2019).

The pre-recorded presentations need to be submitted by 
uploaded by AOE ~~June 17, 2021~~ <span style="color:red;">June 25,</span> 2021.
<i>The upload is as a file directly in CMT, as a second file (see above).</i>
You are free to use any tools you like to create the video. 
Below we have a list of potential tools for your help. 
The requirements for the videos are:

* Duration max. 5 min
* MP4 format
* File size max. 350 MB
* 16:9 aspect ratio (strongly preferred)
* 1920x1080 resolution (strongly preferred, at least 720 height)
* Should ideally have an inset with a video of the speaker

Please email the program chair for questions related to the video submission.

#### Tools for recording the presentations:

* [Debut (Windows, Mac): Free, allows including webcam](https://www.nchsoftware.com/capture/index.html)
* [OBS Studio (Windows, Linux, Mac): OpenSource, allows including webcam](https://obsproject.com/)
* [PowerPoint (Windows, Mac): Narrations and timing can be directly recorded in PowerPoint and exported as videos. Recordings are on a per slide basis (i.e., you cannot talk during slide transitions). Recent versions (Office 365) enable recording a webcam inset as well (Windows only)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/record-a-slide-show-with-narration-and-slide-timings-0b9502c6-5f6c-40ae-b1e7-e47d8741161c?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us)
* [Loom (Windows, Mac): Pro version is free for educational institutions, allows including webcam](https://www.loom.com/education)
* [Zoom (Windows, Linux, Mac): Using “local recording”. Free version is sufficient. Tends not to record videos embedded in the presentation very well, allows including webcam](https://zoom.us/)
* [CamStudio (Windows): OpenSource, allows including webcam](https://camstudio.org/)
* [Ezvid (Windows): Free, allows including webcam](https://www.ezvid.com/download)
* [SimpleScreenRecorder](https://www.maartenbaert.be/simplescreenrecorder/)  / [kazam (Linux): OpenSource, screen capture only](https://launchpad.net/kazam)

#### General tips:

* Prepare a script on what to say. This will also help to cut the video later.
* Record in one long session, repeating parts that you didn't like on the fly.
* Then cut together the parts you like (might be easier if you prepared a script earlier).

#### Free cross platform (Windows, Linux, Mac) video editing tools:

* [DaVinci Resolve: advanced (excellent, but might need nvidia GPU, esp on Linux)](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/sa/products/davinciresolve/)
* [kdenlive: advanced](https://kdenlive.org/en/)
* [ShotCut: advanced ](https://shotcut.org/)
* [avidemux: simple](http://avidemux.sourceforge.net/)
* [lightworks: advanced](https://www.lwks.com/)
* [OpenShot: advanced](https://www.openshot.org/)


## Preparing a poster suitable for the interactive poster sessions in gather.town {#posters}
{: .text-left}

RSS 2021 will try to emulate some of the feeling of an in-person poster session via a <a href="https://gather.town/">gather.town</a> space.
We have sent the corresponding authors a link to a form through which they can upload a file for their poster. (If you have not received this email, please email the [program chair](mailto:dshell@tamu.edu).)
Half an hour before each poster session, the submitted files will be pulled from the form, automatically uploaded, and affixed to the poster stand allotted to you within the space. 
The poster will be seen by navigating toward the virtual poster stand, and hitting the 'x' key. Because this differs from the more traditional printed poster, here are some guidelines that are provided in the
hope that they may be useful:

* The only file formats that are permitted by gather.town are PNG and JPG. The maximum file size supported is 3&nbsp;MB.
* Most people will view the poster full screen, so it is wise to pick a poster proportions (and sub-boxes or content divisions) that approximates those aspect ratios. <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/information/sample-poster.pdf">This example works well</a>, while <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/information/sample-poster2.pdf">this is much less effective</a>.
* There is some ability to move the poster around on screen, which helps as not all screens are identical. Also, one may interactively magnify the view to help see some detail. This means that some smaller text can be legible, even if not at an "arm's length".
* To facilitate clarity and allow reasonable magnification, a resolution of 2000&times;1100 pixels<sup>2</sup> is recommended. We have had good success with more than double that size, so long as respect the requirements on the maximum file size.

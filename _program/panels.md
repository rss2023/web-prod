## XYZ Robotics
{: class="talk-title"}

**Bio:** Peter Yu, co-founder and CTO of XYZ Robotics, received his Ph.D. in EECS from MIT in 2018 and started XYZ afterwards. His research interest was robotic manipulation, specifically, state estimation with physical contact to track object state during manipulation. He received Best Paper Finalist in IROS 2016. Besides academic research, he fought on the front line of robot systems with a belief that they could improve peopleâ€™s lives. In 2013, he participated in DARPA Robotics Challenge to solve disaster relieve tasks. In 2015-2017, he served as the system lead in Amazon Robotics Challenge, and won First Place in Stowing task in 2017.

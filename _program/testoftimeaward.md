The RSS Test of Time Award is given to highest
impact papers published at RSS (and potentially journal versions
thereof) from at least ten years ago. Impact may mean that it changed
how we think about problems or about robotic design, that it brought
fully new problems to the attention of the community, or that it
pioneered new approach to robotic design or problem solving.

With this award, RSS generally wants to foster the discussion of the
long term development of our field. The award is an opportunity to
reflect on and discuss the past, which is essential to make progress in
the future. The awardee's keynote is therefore complemented with a
Test of Time Panel session devoted to this important discussion.

It is our great pleasure to announce that the 2023 Test of Time
Award goes to:

The RSS community is committed to increasing the participation of groups traditionally underrepresented in robotics (including but not limited to: women, LGBTQ+, underrepresented minorities, and people with disabilities), especially people early in their studies and career. Such efforts are crucial for increasing research capacity, creativity, and broadening the impact of robotics research. To that end, Inclusion@RSS will be an integral part of RSS that will focus on programs that increase and sustain a broader participation in the robotics research community. Component programs will range from co-located events to sponsored activities during the main conference.

One key component is the Inclusion@RSS Fellowship Program, which aims to help participants show up and thrive at RSS 2022. Fellowships will be awarded to selected BSc, MSc, and first and second year PhD students. Priority will be given to students who have not previously attended RSS and/or are new to the robotics research community.

On <b>Wednesday 5:00&ndash;6:00pm ET / 2:00&ndash;3:00pm PT</b>, after the workshops have wrapped up for
the day, we will form Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Discussion Groups.
These will be over zoom (possibly multiple zoom rooms), and
consider the question:<br>
<h3><i>How can the robotics community become more diverse and inclusive?</i></h3><br>

Please join us for a working session discussing the issues and strategies to
make positive change. The session will break up into smaller discussion groups
to focus on different areas (students, faculty, conferences, and outreach) for
the majority of the time and then will come together to share with the entire
group. Come prepared to discuss challenges you have seen and any approaches
that have worked for you. Topics include (but are not limited to):

* Improving the experience of diverse grad students

    * Research group dynamics

    * Inclusive teaching

    * Applications, requirements, and program structure

* Recruiting, supporting, and retaining a diverse faculty

    * Recruitment and interviewing practices

    * Department culture

    * RPT structure and evaluation

* Making conferences more inclusive

    * Inclusive reviewing practices

    * Program structure

* Strategies for impactful outreach

    * Scalability and survivability

    * Measurable outcomes

In advance of the discussion group, we encourage you to spend some time reading
and reflecting on these issues. To get you started, consider these resources:

Rather than having a panel, the aim is to get more active engagement and
greater detail in the discussion with small breakout groups. Though some people
are being recruited to facilitate group discussion, the hope is that it will
mostly come from conversatoin among the participants.

Additionally, Inclusion@RSS will have several   meetups in the gather.town space.
These are:
* Black in Robotics "Coffee Break"  meetup on Monday 7/12 at 11:30-12:30 ET/ 8:30-9:30 PT.
* Women in Robotics event on Tuesday 7/13 at 11:00-12:00 ET/ 8:00-9:00 PT.
* Queer in AI "Fireside Chat" on Wednesday 7/14 at 9:00 ET/06:00 PT.

The primary goal of the 2021 Inclusion@RSS is to increase the number of new
conference participants from groups traditionally underrepresented in robotics.
Fellowships will be awarded to selected BSc, MSc, and first and second year PhD
students. Priority will be given to students who have not previously attended
RSS and/or are new to the robotics research community.

The RSS community is committed to increasing the participation of groups
traditionally underrepresented in robotics (including but not limited to:
women, LGBTQ+, underrepresented minorities, and people with disabilities),
especially people early in their studies and career. To that end, RSS is
providing a special workshops-only registration at a reduced rate ($67.50) for
undergraduates who identify as belonging to an underrepresented group.

To obtain the registration code, please email
[rss2017inclusion@gmail.com](mailto:rss2017inclusion@gmail.com) with your name
and institution name. You will then receive a code to use during registration.
To register, go to the registration site and choose  "Student Registration:
Workshop Only"  and apply the registration code. The code is valid until the
registration website closes on July 5th. Note that when you pick up your badge,
you will need to show proof that you are currently an undergraduate student.

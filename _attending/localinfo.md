New York City is mainly served by three airports: JFK, EWR and LGA. JFK and EWR are at similar distances from Manhattan and Columbia’s campus (approximately 60 minutes by car, with various public transportation options also available). LGA is closer to Columbia (approximately 30 minutes by car) but is mainly a domestic airport with fewer flights available.

New York City offers a huge range of hotels, at many price options. Due to easy connection with the [1, 2 and 3 subway lines](https://map.mta.info/#@40.8046036,-73.9636683,15.31z), hotels in a huge part of Manhattan (including Midtown and down to the Financial District) are within a 20-30 minute travel distance to the Columbia campus. A smaller number of hotels are also available on the Upper West Side, within a 10-minute subway or taxi ride of the campus. 


## Venue

RSS 2022 will take place in New York City, mainly hosted on Columbia University’s [Morningside Campus](https://cufo.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/morningsidemap_2015aug-7.pdf). The campus is located in the [Morningside Heights neighborhood](https://morningside-alliance.org/) of Manhattan, close to Central Park. It is well connected via [subway lines](https://map.mta.info/#@40.8046036,-73.9636683,15.31z) to the entire city, with more attractions and places of interest than we could hope to list here.
